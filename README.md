GifTastic is a fun app that displays Gifs from favorite your TV shows. Users can view Gifs by clicking one of the TV show buttons displayed, or adding their own favorite show and selecting "Add TV Show!" Giftastic is written in Javascript and uses the Giphy API to access Gifs based on words stored in an array, or searched (by the user).   

Giftastic is ready to use as soon as the page is loaded. Simply click the name of the show you would like to see, or enter the name of a new one. When you click "Add a TV Show!" a new button will appear. Click the button and check out the Gifs!
